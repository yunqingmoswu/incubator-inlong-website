Background\\n\\nWith the increasing number of users and developers of Apache InLong(incubating), the demand for richer usage scenarios and low-cost operation is getting stronger and stronger. Among them, the demand for adding Transform (T) to the whole link of InLong has received the most feedback. After the research and design of @yunqingmoswu, @EMsnap, @gong, @thexiay community developers, the InLong Sort ETL solution based on Flink SQL has been completed. This article will introduce the implementation details of the solution in detail.\\n\\nFirstly, based on Apache Flink SQL, there are mainly the following considerations\uff1a\\n\\n-  Flink SQL has high scalability and flexibility brought about by its powerful expression ability. Basically, Flink SQL can support most demand scenarios in the community. When the built-in functions of Flink SQL do not meet the requirements, we can also extend them through various UDFs.\\n-  Compared with the implementation of the underlying API of Flink, the development cost of Flink SQL is lower. Only for the first time, the conversion logic of Flink SQL needs to be implemented. In the future, we can focus on the construction of the ability of Flink SQL, such as the extension connector and the UDF.\\n- In general, Flink SQL will be more robust and run more stable. The reason is that Flink SQL shields a lot of the underlying details of Flink, has strong community support, and has been practiced by a large number of users.\\n- For users, Flink SQL is also easier to understand, especially for users who have used SQL, the usage is simple and familiar, which helps users to land quickly.\\n- For the migration of existing real-time tasks, if they are originally SQL-type tasks, especially Flink SQL tasks, the migration cost is extremely low, and in some cases, no changes are even required.\\n\\n**Note**: For all codes of this scheme, please refer to [Apache InLong Sort](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/tree/master/inlong-sort), which can be downloaded and used in the upcoming version 1.2.0.\\n\\n## 2. Introduction\\n\\n### 2.1 Requirements\\n\\nThe main requirements of this solution are the completed inlong sort module transform (T) capability, including:\\n\\n|          Transform          |                            Notes                             |\\n| :-------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |\\n| Deduplication in the window |            Deduplicate data within a time window             |\\n|   time window aggregation   |             Aggregate data within a time window              |\\n|   time format conversion    | Converts the value of a field to a string in the target time format |\\n|     field segmentation      |    Split a field into multiple new fields by a delimiter     |\\n|     string replacement      |    Replace some or all of the contents of a string field     |\\n|       Data filtering        |   Discard or retain data that meets the filter conditions    |\\n|     Content extraction      |        Extract part of a field to create a new field         |\\n|            Join             |                    Support two table join                    |\\n|     Value substitution      | Given a matching value, if the field\'s value is equal to that value, replace it with the target value |\\n\\n### 2.2 Usage Scenarios\\n\\nUsers of big data integration have transform requirements such as data transformation, connection and filtering in many business scenarios.\\n\\n### 2.3 Design Goal\\n\\nThis design needs to achieve the following goals:\\n\\n- Functionality: Under InLong Sort\'s existing architecture and data flow model, it covers basic Transform capabilities and has the ability to expand rapidly.\\n- Compatibility: The new InLong Sort data model is forward compatible to ensure that historical tasks can be configured and run properly.\\n- Maintainability: The conversion of the InLong Sort data model to Flink SQL only needs to be implemented once. When there are new functional requirements later, this part does not need to be changed, even if there are changes, it can be supported with a small amount of changes.\\n- Extensibility: When the open source Flink Connector or the built-in Flink SQL function does not meet the requirements, you can customize the Flink Connector and UDF to achieve its function expansion.\\n\\n### 2.4 Basic Concepts\\n\\nThe core concept refers to the explanation of terms in the outline design\\n\\n|            Name             |                           Meaning                            |\\n| :-------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |\\n|      InLong Dashboard       |            Inlong front end management interface             |\\n|    InLong Manager Client    | Wrap the interface in the manager for external user programs to call without going through the front-end inlong dashboard |\\n|   InLong Manager Openapi    |      Inlong manager and external system call interface       |\\n|   InLong Manager metaData   | Inlong manager metadata management, including metadata information of group and stream dimensions |\\n| InLong Manager task manager | Inlong manager manages the data source collection task module, manages agent task distribution, instruction distribution, and heartbeat reporting |\\n|        InLong Group         | Data flow group, including multiple data flows, one group represents one data access |\\n|        InLong Stream        |     Data flow: a data flow has a specific flow direction     |\\n|        Stream Source        | There are corresponding acquisition end and sink end in the stream.

Through Manager Client, users can build InLong into any third-party platform to achieve unified customized platform construction. The Manager Client is mainly designed and implemented by @kipshi, @gong, @ciscozhou, thanks to three contributors.\\n\\n### Add ManagerCtl command line tool\\nManagerCtl is developed based on Manager Client and is a command-line tool for manipulating InLong resources, which can further simplify the use of developers. ManagerCtl was contributed independently by @haifxu and includes guidelines including:\\n```\\nUsage: managerctl [options] [command] [command options]\\nOptions:\\n-h, --help\\nGet all command about managerctl.\\nCommands:\\ncreate      Create resource by json file\\nUsage: create [options]\\n\u200b\\ndescribe      Display details of one or more resources\\nUsage: describe [options]\\n\u200b\\nlist      Displays main information for one or more resources\\nUsage: list [options]\\n```\\n\\n### Manager supports issuing Sort tasks\\nIn previous versions, after the user created the data group/stream task, Sort needed to submit it to the Flink cluster through the command line, and then perform data sorting. In version 1.1.0, we unified the start, stop, and suspend operations of Sort tasks to the Manager to complete. Users only need to configure the correct Flink cluster when the Manager is deployed. When the data stream is approved, Sort will be automatically started. \\nThis part of the work is mainly contributed by @LvJiancheng.\\n\\n### Manager metadata is saved to ZooKeeper\\nInLong uses ZooKeeper to save data stream metadata, which increases the deployment threshold and operation and maintenance difficulty for developers and users. \\nIn version 1.1.0, we save data stream metadata in DB by default, and ZooKeeper is only an optional solution in large-scale scenarios. Thanks to @kipshi @yunqingmoswu for contributing a PR to ZooKeeper.\\n\\n### Support MySQL Binlog collection\\nVersion 1.1.0 fully supports the collection of data from MySQL, and supports both incremental and full strategies. Users can collect MySQL data with simple configuration in InLong. This part of the work was contributed by @EMsnap.\\n\\n### Sort Added Iceberg, ClickHouse, Kafka\\nIn version 1.1.0, the storage of data nodes for various scenarios has been added, including Iceberg, ClickHouse, and Kafka. The support of these three streams enriches the usage scenarios of InLong. New stream support, mainly contributed by @chantccc @KevinWen007 @healchow.\\n\\n### Sort Standalone supports Hive, Elasticsearch, Kafka\\nAs mentioned in the previous version, for non-Flink environments, we can sort data streams through Sort Standalone. In version 1.1.0, we added support for Hive, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and expanded the usage scenarios of Sort Standalone. Sort Standalone is mainly contributed by @vernedeng @luchunliang.\\n\\n### Protocol Buffers upgrade\\nAll InLong components Protocol Buffers dependencies have been upgraded from 2.5.0 to 3.19.4. Thanks to @gosonzhang @doleyzi for their contributions, a lot of compatibility and testing work for Protocol Buffers upgrades.\\n\\n### InLong on Kubernetes optimization\\nThe optimization work of InLong on Kubernetes mainly includes adding Audit, combing configuration, optimizing the use of message queues, optimizing the use of documents, etc., to facilitate the use of InLong on the cloud. Thanks to @shink for contributing to these optimizations.\\n\\n### Dashboard plugin\\nIn order to facilitate users to quickly build new data stream on Dashboard, Dashboard is support plugin in version 1.1.0. JavaScript developers who understand the plugin development guidelines can quickly expand new data stream. Thanks for this part of the work @leezng\\n\\n### Other features and bug fixes\\nFor related content, please refer to the version [release notes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/blob/master/CHANGES.md), which list the features, enhancements and bug fixes of this version in detail, as well as specific contributors.\\n\\n## Apache InLong(incubating) follow-up planning\\nIn subsequent versions, we will support lightweight Sort, and expand more data sources and targets to cover more usage scenarios, including:\\n- Flink SQL support\\n- Elasticsearch, HBase support"},{"id":"/2022/01/04/release-0.12.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/04/release-0.12.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2022-01-04-release-0.12.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-04-release-0.12.0.md","title":"Release InLong 0.12.0","description":"InLong: the sacred animal in Chinese myths stories, draws rivers into the sea, as a metaphor for the InLong system to provide data access capabilities.","date":"2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 4, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":5.15,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release InLong 0.12.0"},"prevItem":{"title":"Release InLong 1.1.0","permalink":"/blog/2022/04/25/release-1.1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release InLong 0.11.0","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/10/release-0.11.0"}},"content":"InLong: the sacred animal in Chinese myths stories, draws rivers into the sea, as a metaphor for the InLong system to provide data access capabilities.\\n\\nApache InLong is a one-stop integration framework for massive data that provides automatic, secure and reliable data transmission capabilities.

It provides automatic,  safe,  reliable,  and high-performance data transmission capabilities to facilitate the construction of streaming-based data analysis,  modeling,  and applications.  \\nThe Apache InLong project was originally called TubeMQ,  focusing on high-performance,  low-cost message queuing services.  In order to further release the surrounding ecological capabilities of TubeMQ,  we upgraded the project to InLong,  focusing on creating a one-stop integration framework for massive data.\\n\\nApache InLong uses TDBank internally used by Tencent as the prototype,  and relies on trillion-level data access and processing capabilities to integrate the entire process of data collection,  aggregation,  storage,  and sorting data processing.  It is simple to use,  flexible to expand,  stable and reliable characteristic.\\n<img src=\\"/img/inlong-structure-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Apache InLong\\"/>\\n\\nApache InLong serves the entire life cycle from data collection to landing,  and provides different processing modules according to different stages of data,  including the next modules:\\n- **inlong-agent**,  data collection agent, supports reading regular logs from specified directories or files and reporting data one by one.  In the future,  DB collection and HTTP reporting capabilities will also be expanded.\\n- **inlong-dataproxy**,  a Proxy component based on Flume-ng,  supports data transmission blocking,  placing retransmission, and has the ability to forward received data to different MQ (message queues).\\n- **inlong-tubemq**,  Tencent\'s self-developed message queuing service,  focuses on high-performance storage and transmission of massive data in big data scenarios and has a relatively good core advantage in mass practice and low cost.\\n- **inlong-sort**,  after consuming data from different MQ services,  perform ETL processing,  and then aggregate and write the data into Apache Hive, ClickHouse,  Hbase,  IceBerg,  etc.\\n- **inlong-manager**, provides complete data service management and control capabilities,  including metadata,  OpenAPI,  task flow,  authority,  etc.\\n- **inlong-website**, a front-end page for managing data access,  simplifying the use of the entire InLong control platform.\\n\\n### What\u2019s New in Apache InLong(incubating) 0.12.0\\n#### 1. Support Apache Pulsar data cache\\nIn version 0.12.0, we have completed the data reporting capability of FileAgent\u2192DataProxy\u2192Pulsar\u2192Sort. So far, InLong supports high-performance and high-reliability data access scenarios: Compared with the high-throughput TubeMQ, Apache Pulsar can provide better data consistency and is more suitable for scenarios that require extremely high data reliability. For example, finance and billing.\\n<img src=\\"/img/pulsar-arch-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Report via Pulsar\\"/>\\n\\nThanks to @healchow, @baomingyu, @leezng, @bruceneenhl, @ifndef-SleePy and others for their contributions to this feature.
